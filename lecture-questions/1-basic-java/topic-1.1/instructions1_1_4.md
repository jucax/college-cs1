# 1.2 Primitive data, variables and I/O lecture questions 
## Exercise 4 / 6
### Instructions:
TASK: Write a program that does the following:

1. Create a Scanner that reads from `System.in`
2. Prompt the user with the prompt: `“Enter your month of birth: ”`
3. Store the result in a variable called `month`
4. Prompt the user with the prompt: `“Enter your day of birth: ”`
5. Store the result in a variable called `day`
6. Prompt the user twitch the prompt: `“Enter your year of birth: ”`
7. Store the result in a variable called `year`
You should decide what types to use 

NOTE: In the lecture slides we used `System.out.print` for scanner prompts. For this problem, please use `System.out.println` to print out the user prompts.
NOTE: You don't need to write the code to declare the class or the main method. You also don't need to `import` anything. We've done that behind the scenes. Just write the `Scanner` code.
