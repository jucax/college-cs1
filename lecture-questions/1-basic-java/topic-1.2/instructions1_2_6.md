# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic lecture questions 
## Exercise 6 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have a variable of type `int` called `numStudents`, which represents the number of students in class today, using the following line of code.

```
int numStudents = ??; 'numStudents' can have any int value
```

We want to determine if we will be able to implement a group activity. We need either of the following conditions to hold:

- `numStudents` is at least `50`
- `numStudents` is at least `10` and is a multiple of `4`

TASK: Create a boolean variable called `isFeasible` that is true if and only if `numStudents` meet those criteria
