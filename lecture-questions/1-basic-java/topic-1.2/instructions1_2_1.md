# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic lecture questions 
## Exercise 1 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called `num`.

TASK: Create a variable of type `int` called `leadingDigits`.  It should have all of the same digits as `num` except for the last digit. If there is only one digit then `leadingDigits` should be set to `0`.
