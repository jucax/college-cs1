# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic lecture questions 
## Exercise 4 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `numCars` , another variable of type `int` called  `numFamilies` , and a variable of type int called carsPerFamily with the following lines of code:

```
int numCars = ??; // 'numCars' can have any int value
int numFamilies = ??; // 'numFamilies' can have any int value
int carsPerFamily; // we have already declared this variable
```

Then, assume we have gotten some new inventory, and we have increased our studio size.

TASK:
- Update `numCars` to be 5 times as big as it was before
- Update `numFamilies` to include 26 more families
- Update `carsPerFamily` - itâ€™s the same formula as before, but update the variable to reflect the updated values of `numCars` and `numFamilies`
