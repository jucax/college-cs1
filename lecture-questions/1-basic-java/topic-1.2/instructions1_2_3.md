# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic lecture questions 
## Exercise 3 / 6
### Instructions:
You are Oprah. You have many cars to give away, and you have many families that are visiting your studio today. You want to figure out how many cars every family will get (assuming we donâ€™t give anybody a fraction of a car). You want to figure out how many cars were actually given away, and how many cars were leftover. You want to check if every family got at least two cars.

Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `numCars` and another variable of type `int` called  `numFamilies` with the following lines of code:

```
int numCars = ??; // numCars can be any integer
int numFamilies = ??; // numFamilies can be any integer
```

TASK: Create the following variables with the following values:
- `carsPerFamily` - the number of cars that each family gets if the cars are divided equally
- `distributedCars` - the number of cars that were given out
- `leftoverCars` - the number of remaining cars after we divide them amongst the families
- `isEnough` - a variable that is `true` if each family got 2 or more cars, and `false` otherwise
