TASK: Write is a `public` method called `leadingDigits`. It should have a single parameter `int num`. It should return an `int` containing all of the same digits as `num` except for the last digit. If there is only one digit then your method should return `0`.

HINT: You can (and should) re-use code from you wrote on a problem from the Operators and Boolean Logic Lecture Questions assignment!
