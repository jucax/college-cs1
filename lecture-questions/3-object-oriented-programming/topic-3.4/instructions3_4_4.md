# 3.4  Methods lecture questions
## Exercise 4 / 8
### Instructions:
A DNA sequence can be thought of as a string over the alphabet `{A,C,G,T}`. The "GC-Content" of a DNA sequence is the proportion of characters of the sequence that are either `G` or `C`. For example, the GC-Content of the sequence `ACGTA` is `2/5 = 0.4`.

Assume we have created a class called `GenomeAnalyzer`.

TASK: Write a `public` method called `gcContent` with one `String` parameter `sequence`. It should return the GC-Content of `sequence` as a `double`.
