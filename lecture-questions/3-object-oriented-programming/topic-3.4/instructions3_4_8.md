# 3.4  Methods lecture questions
## Exercise 8 / 8
### Instructions:
Assume we have created a class called `ArrayUtils`.

```
class ArrayUtils
{

}
```

TASK: Write a `public` method called `arrayAbsoluteValue` that has one parameter of type `double[]`. All negative values in the array should be changed to positive values; any values that were originally 0 or positive should stay the same. The method should not return anything - it should modify the array in place.
