# 4.3  Recursion lecture questions
## Exercise 2 / 5
### Instructions:
 Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `num` with the following line of code:

```
int num = ???; // 'num' can have any int value
```

TASK: Write a `public static` method called `numToArrayList`. It should have a single parameter `int num`. It should have a return type of `ArrayList<Integer>`. It should return an `ArrayList<Integer>` that contains `num` (and no other values).

HINT: You should be able to do this in 3 lines of code! Don't overthink this!
