# 4.3  Recursion lecture questions
## Exercise 4 / 5
### Instructions:
TASK: Write a `public static` method called `combinedArrayLists`. It should have two parameters: `ArrayList<Integer> list1` and `ArrayList<Integer> list2`. It should return a single `ArrayList<Integer>` which contains all of the elements of `list1` and `list2`.

HINT: You can use the `addAll` method of the `ArrayList` class to copy the contents of one `ArrayList` into another `ArrayList`. For example, suppose we have declared two `ArrayList<Integer>` objects called `arr1` and `arr2`. Then `arr1.addAll(arr2)` will copy all of the contents from `arr2` into `arr1`.
