# 4.3  Recursion lecture questions
## Exercise 3 / 5
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `num` with the following line of code:

```
int num = ???; // 'num' can have any int value
```

TASK: Write a `public static` method called `smallestNonTrivialFactor`. It should have a single parameter `int num`. It should have an `int` return type. It should return the smallest number `k` such that k > 1 and `num` is divisible by `k`.
