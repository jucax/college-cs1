# 4.2  Scanners and command line args lecture questions
## Exercise 5 / 5
### Instructions:
TASK: Assume we have defined a class called `CommandLinePractice` with a `main` method as follows:

```
class CommandLinePractice
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Fill in the `main` method so that reads all of the test scores as command line arguments, and prints out the average value of the test scores.

EXAMPLE: If I run

`java CommandLinePractice 40 50 90`

Your program should print out `(40 + 50 + 90) / 3 = 60`
