# 4.2  Scanners and command line args lecture questions
## Exercise 2 / 5
### Instructions:
TASK: Write a program that does the following:

1. Create a `Scanner` object that reads from `System.in`
2. Prompt the user as follows: `"Enter all of the studentsâ€™ test scores (separated by spaces):"`
3. Read all of the test scores the user entered. You may assume they are all `int`s.
4. Print out the average value of the test scores.

NOTE: In the lecture slides we typically used `System.out.print` for Scanner prompts. Please use `println` for all printing in this question.

NOTE: you don't need to write a class or `main` method header, and you don't need to `import` `Scanner`. We've done all of that behind the scenes. Just write the body of the main method as described above.
