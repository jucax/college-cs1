## Exercise 4 / 11
### Instructions:
We have declared a method called `minValueStartingFrom`. It has two parameters: `ArrayList<Integer> nums` and `int startIndex`. You may assume that `nums` is non-empty - there will always be at least one element. You may also assume that **0 â‰¤ startIndex < nums.size()**

TASK: Fill in the body of the method so that it returns the minimum element that occurs at or after `startIndex`. So for example, if `startIndex` is `3`, then we should find and return the minimum element that occurs at position `3` or later.

EXAMPLE: If `nums` contains `1, -2, 4, -1, 10, 5` and `startIndex` is `0`, then we would return `-2`. That's because we only consider elements from position 0 onwards, so we only consider the numbers `1, -2, 4, -1, 10, 5`, and the minimum of these elements is `-2` .

EXAMPLE: If `nums` contains `1, -2, 4, -1, 10, 5` and `startIndex` is `1`, then we would return `-2`. That's because we only consider elements from position `1` onwards, so we only consider the numbers `-2, 4, -1, 10, 5`, and the minimum of these elements is `-2` .
