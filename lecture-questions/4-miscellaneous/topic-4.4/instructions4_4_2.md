## Exercise 2 / 11
### Instructions:
We have declared a method called `minIndex`. It has a single parameter `ArrayList<Integer> nums`. You may assume that `nums` is non-empty - there will always be at least one element.

TASK: Fill in the body of the method so that it returns the index of the minimum element. It should not return the minimum element - it should return the (0-based-indexed) position where the smallest element is located.

If there are multiple indices tied for the smallest value, you should return the first index that contains the minimum value.
