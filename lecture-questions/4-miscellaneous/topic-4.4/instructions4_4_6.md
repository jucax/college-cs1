## Exercise 6 / 11
### Instructions:
We have declared a method called `arrayListSwap`. It has three parameters `ArrayList<Integer> nums, int firstPos, int secondPos`. You may assume that `nums` is non-empty, and you may assume that **0 â‰¤ firstPos , secondPos < nums.size()**

TASK: Fill in the body of the method so that it swaps the values at `first` and `second`.  It should modify `nums` in place. It should not return anything.

HINT: Use the `set` method of the `ArrayList` class.
