# 2.1 Conditionals lecture questions 
## Exercise 2 / 5
### Instructions:
Suppose we are writing a program for a card game. We want to check if a particular number is a valid card number.
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called called `cardValue` with the following lines of code:

```
int cardValue = ??; // 'cardValue' can have any int value
```

TASK:

- Print out `“The card value is ___”` (with cardValue in place of the `___`). Do this no matter what the card value is
- Check if `cardValue` is between 2 and 14 (11-14 are face cards)
    - If cardValue is between 2 and 14, print out “This is a valid card value!”
    - If it's not, print out “This is not a valid card value!”
