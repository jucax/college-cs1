# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 6 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have created a variable of type `int` called `num` with the following line of code:

```
int num = ??; // num can have any non-negative int value
```

We want to print out the first `num` positive square numbers.
EXAMPLE: if `num` is `5`, we would output

```
1
4
9
16
25
```

EXAMPLE: if `num` is `8`, we would output

```
1
4
9
16
25
36
49

```
