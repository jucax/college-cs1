# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 5 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `numHashtags` using the following line of code:

```
int numHashtags = ???; // numHashtags can have any non-negative int value
```

TASK: Write a loop to print out the `‘#’` character exactly `numHashtags` times. You should print them all out on the same line.
