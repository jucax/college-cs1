# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 4 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called `firstFriday`, which represents the which day of the year the first Friday occurs, using the following line of code:

```
int firstFriday = ???; // firstFriday can be any number between 1 and 7
```

TASK: Write a loop that prints out all of the days this year that are a Friday.

EXAMPLE: suppose `firstFriday` is 3. Then this means that the first Friday of the year occurs on the third overall day of the year. We would print out

```
3
10
17
24
â€¦
360
```
