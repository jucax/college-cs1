# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 7 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called `num` with the following line of code:

```
int num = ???; // num can have any positive int value
```

TASK: Write a loop that computes and prints out the sum of the first `num` positive square numbers.

EXAMPLE: if `num` is `5`, we would output `55`, because

```
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55
```

EXAMPLE: if `num` is `8`, we would output `204`, because

```
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 36 + 49 + 64 = 204
```
