# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 9 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `String` called `str` with the following line of code:

```
String str = "???"; // str can have any String value
```

TASK: Create a variable of type `String` called `reversedStr` that contains the same symbols as str but in reverse order.
NOTE: Don't print out anything! Just create the variable.
