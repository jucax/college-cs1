# 2.2 While/For loops lecture questions 
## Exercise 2 / 9
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable called `grootLines` with the following line of code:

```
int grootLines = ???; // grootLines can have any int value
```

TASK: Write a `while` loop that prints out `“I am Groot”` exactly `grootLines` times. So if `grootLines` is `500`, we would print out `“I am Groot”` exactly `500` times.
Note that because `grootLines` is a variable that is not given a value until runtime, then it is literally impossible to write this code without a loop.
