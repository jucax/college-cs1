# 2.3 Nested loops, boolean flags, break, continue lecture questions
## Exercise 1 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called `size` with the following line of code:

```
int size = ???; // size can have any positive int value
```

TASK: Write a program that prints out an “asterisk square” of with exactly `size` rows and `size` columns.

EXAMPLE: if `size` were `5`, you would print out the following:

```
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
```
