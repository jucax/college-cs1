## Exercise 2 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable of type `int` called `size` with the following line of code:

```
int size = ???; // size can have any positive int value
```

TASK: Write a program that prints out an “asterisk triangle” of with exactly `size` rows. An "asterisk triangle" has exactly `size` rows; the first row has 1 asterisk, the second row has two asterisks, and so on; the last row has exactly `size` asterisks.
EXAMPLE: if `size` were `5`, you would print out the following:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

There are exactly `5` rows. The first row has `1` asterisk, the second row has `2` asterisks, and so on, up until `5` asterisks in the final row.
