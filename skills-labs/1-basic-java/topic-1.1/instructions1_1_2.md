# 1.1 Primitive data, variables and I/O skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 5
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `firstNum` and another variable of type `int` called `secondNum` with the following lines of code:

```
int firstNum = ???;  // 'firstNum' can have any int value
int secondNum = ???; // 'secondNum' can have any int value
```

TASK: Swap the values of `firstNum` and `secondNum`.

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the `main` method. We have already done that behind the scenes.

NOTE: You do not need to create the variables `firstNum` and `secondNum`. We have already done that behind the scenes. You just need to re-assign them so that their values are swapped.

NOTE: Don't print out anything! Just swap the variable values. We will print out the variables behind the scenes to check that you swapped them correctly; if you add your own print statements then the output won't be correct.

HINT: You are allowed to create additional variables to help you swap the two original variables.
