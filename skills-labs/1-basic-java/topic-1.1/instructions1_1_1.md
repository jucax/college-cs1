# 1.1 Primitive data, variables and I/O skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 5
### Instructions:
TASK: Print out the following message:

```
**************************************
*                                    *
* Hello, Newman! Welcome to CS 7! :) *
*                                    *
**************************************
```

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the main method. We have already done that behind the scenes. All you need to do is write the code for printing out the message.

NOTE: You may use any combination of `print` and `println`, and you may use as many or as few `print/println` statements as you like. We are only grading you on producing the correct output.
