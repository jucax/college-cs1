# 1.1 Primitive data, variables and I/O skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 5
### Instructions:
TASK: Create a `Scanner` object that reads from `System.in`. Prompt the user with the following message:

`Enter a city, state, and zip code (separated by spaces, with no commas):`

Note that there is no blank space after the colon.

Then, use Scan`ner methods we learned about in class to parse the input tokens and create the following three variables:

- `city` (of type `String`)
- `state` (of type `String`)
- `zipCode` (of type `long`)

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the main method. You also do not need to write an `import` statement for `Scanner`. We have already done that behind the scenes.

NOTE: In the lecture slides we used `System.out.print` for scanner prompts. For this problem, please use `System.out.println` to print out the user prompts.

NOTE: Don't print out the variables that you create! Just create the variables. We will print out the variables behind the scenes to check that you created them correctly; if you add your own print statements then the output won't be correct.
