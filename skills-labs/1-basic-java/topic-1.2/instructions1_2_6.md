# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic skills lab
## Exercise 6 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have declared a variable of type `int` called `num`. You may assume that `num` has exactly 5 digits.

TASK: print out all of the sum of the digits of `num`. For example:

- If `num` is `10000` then you should print `1` (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)
- If `num` is `99999` then you should print `45` (9 + 9 + 9.+ 9 + 9)
- If `num` is `19302` then you should print `15` (1 + 9 + 3 + 0 + 2)
- If `num` is `75782` then you should print `29` (7 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 2)
- If `num` is `11008` then you should print `10` (1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 8)

HINT: You may wish to review the lecture questions on operators - you completed a task that shows you how to separate the last digit from the first n - 1 digits!
