# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic skills lab
## Exercise 5 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have declared a variable of type `int` called `num`. You may assume that num has exactly 5 digits.

TASK: print out all of the digits of `num` in reverse order.

HINT: You may wish to review the lecture questions on operators - you completed a task that shows you how to separate the last digit from the first n - 1 digits!

HINT: Another approach involves converting `num` to a `String` and repeatedly using the `charAt` method.
