# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 6
### Instructions:
TASK: Create a `String` variable called `message` that contains the following contents:

```
**************************************
*                                    *
* Hello, Newman! Welcome to CS 7! :) *
*                                    *
**************************************
```

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the main method. We have already done that behind the scenes. All you need to do is write the code for creating the variable `message`.

NOTE: Please do NOT print anything out for this problem! We handle printing behind the scenes. Just create the variable `message` without printing it out.

NOTE: This is the same text as from Step 4 on Lab 1, but the problem is different. You aren't printing the text out, but rather you are storing the text in a `String` variable.

HINT: Use **String** concatenation!

HINT: You can use the newline character `'\n'` to add a line break into your String.
