# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `String` called `firstString`, a variable of type `String` called `secondString`, and a variable of type `char` called `delim` with the following lines of code:

```
String firstString = "???";  // 'firstString' can have any String value
String secondString = "???";  // 'secondString' can have any String value
char delim = ???; // 'delim' can have any char value
```

TASK: Create a variable concat that is the concatenation of `firstString`, `delim`, and `secondString`.

EXAMPLE: If `firstString` was `"Fast"`, `secondString` was `"Furious"`, and `delim` was `'&'`, `concat` would be `"Fast&Furious"`.

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the main method. We have already done that behind the scenes.

NOTE: You do not need to create the variables `firstString`, `delim`, and `secondString`. We have already done that behind the scenes. You just need to write the code to concatenate the values.

HINT: Don't print out anything! Just create the variable. We will print it out behind the scenes to check that you created the variable correctly; if you add your own print statements then the output won't be correct.
