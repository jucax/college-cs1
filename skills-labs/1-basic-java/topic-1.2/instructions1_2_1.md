# 1.2 Operators and boolean logic skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 6
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `base` and another variable of type `int` called `height` with the following lines of code:

```
int base = ???;   // 'base' can have any int value
int height = ???; // 'height' can have any int value
```

TASK: Print the area of a triangle with base `base` and `height` height.

HINT: Recall that the area of a triangle is half of the product of its base and height.

NOTE: You do not need to write the class or the main method. We have already done that behind the scenes.

NOTE: You do not need to create the variables `base` and `height`. We have already done that behind the scenes. You just need to write the code for printing out the value of the area of the triangle.
