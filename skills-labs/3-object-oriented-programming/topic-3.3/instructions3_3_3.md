# 3.3 Constructors, modifiers, and encapsulation skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 3
### Instructions:
TASK: Create a class called `FancyArray` that has the following `private` instance variables:

- `array`, which is an `int[]`
- `delim`, which is a `String`

As well as the following `public` constructor:

- A constructor with one `int[]` parameter `array` and one `String` parameter `delim`, which sets the `array` and `delim` instance variables to the corresponding values of the arguments. You can assume we will not give you an empty array

And the following `public` methods:

- `getArray`, which has no parameters and returns the `array` instance variable
- `getDelim`, which has no parameters and returns the `delim` instance variable
- `print`, which has no parameters and prints the elements of the `array` instance variable such that they are delimited by the `delim` instance variable. This method does not return anything, it only prints.

NOTE: You only need to create the `FancyArray` class. You do not need to write a `main` method.
