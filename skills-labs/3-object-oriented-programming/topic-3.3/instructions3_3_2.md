# 3.3 Constructors, modifiers, and encapsulation skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 3
### Instructions:
TASK: Create a class called `Rectangle` that has the following `private` instance variables:

- `width`, which is a `double`
- `height`, which is a `double`

As well as the following `public` constructors:

- A constructor with one `double` parameter `sideLength`, which sets both the `width` and `height` instance variables to `sideLength`
- A constructor with two `double` parameters `width` and `height`, which sets both the `width` and `height` instance variables to the corresponding values that were passed in

And the following `public` methods:

- `computeArea`, which has no parameters and returns the area of the `Rectangle` object as a `double`
- `computePerimeter`, which has no parameters and returns the perimeter of the `Rectangle` object as a `double`
- `getHeight`, which has no parameters and returns the height of the `Rectangle` object as a `double`
- `getWidth`, which has no parameters and returns the width of the `Rectangle` object as a `double`

NOTE: You only need to create the `Rectangle` class. You don't need to make a `main` method.
