# 3.2 Classes and instance methods skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 4
### Instructions:
Flatland is a fictional two-dimensional world inhabited by sentient two-dimensional shapes (e.g. Square, Circle, Triangle, etc.). Let's imagine all buildings in Flatland must be rectangles with a width of 30 and a height of 50. Also imagine all buildings must be purple.

TASK: Create a class called `Building` that has 3 instance variables: `int width`, `int height`, and `String color`. They should be initialized to `30`, `50`, and `"purple"`, respectively.

NOTE: **Do not create a main method**. Just create the Building class, and we will take care of writing a separate main method to test it behind the scenes.
