# 3.2 Classes and instance methods skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 4
### Instructions:
We have created a `Car` class with the following methods (we're intentionally hiding implementation details from you):

```
class Car {
    public String getMake();  // get the car's make
    public String getModel(); // get the car's model
    public String getNoise(); // returns a String of the noise the car makes
}
```

TASK: Create a class called `MyProgram` with a `main` method that does the following tasks:

1. Create a new `Car` object
2. Print its make
3. Print its model
4. Print the noise it makes

NOTE: Do not attempt to write your own `Car` class. We did this behind the scenes. The `Car` class already exists. Your task is to simply create a `Car` object and call its methods.
