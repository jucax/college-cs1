# 3.2 Classes and instance methods skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 4
### Instructions:
Let's now use the `Building` class from the previous problem. Recall that every `Building` has a `width`, `height`, and `color`.

TASK: do the following:

Create a new `Building` object called `building`
Set the `height` of `building` to 15
Set the `width` of `building` to 45
Set the `color` of `building` to `"orange"`

NOTE: **Do not (re)-create the** `Building` **class**. This time, we've written the class behind the scenes.

NOTE: **Do not create a** `main` **method**. Just write the code to create the object and set all of its fields.

NOTE: **Do not print anything**. We print out `height`, `width`, and `color` behind the scenes. If you add your own print statements, then these values will get printed twice and your output will look incorrect.
