# 3.4 Methods skills lab
## Exercise 4 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a class called `ArrayUtils`.

TASK: Write a `public` method called `reverse` with one `int[]` parameter `nums`. It should reverse the elements of `nums`. It should not return anything - it should modify `nums` in place.

NOTE:  Do not print anything. We take care of printing behind the scenes.

NOTE: You do not need to create a class. Just write the method.
