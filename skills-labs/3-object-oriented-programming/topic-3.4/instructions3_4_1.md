# 3.4 Methods skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 7
### Instructions:
Recall that n! ("n factorial") = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.

TASK: Write a `public` method called `factorial` with one `int` parameter `n`. It should return n!. You can assume `n` < 20.

HINT: Make a variable to keep track of the running product of all the numbers you've seen. Then write a loop that goes through each number, and updates the running product to include this number.

HINT: Remember that 0! = 1

HINT: Watch out for `int` overflow! Choose the return type for your method carefully...

NOTE:  Do not print anything. We take care of printing behind the scenes. But you should return something.

NOTE: You do not need to create a class. Just write the method.
