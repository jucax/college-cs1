# 3.4 Methods skills lab
## Exercise 5 / 7
### Instructions:
TASK: Write is a `public static` method called `printReversedDigits`. It should have a single parameter `int num`. It should not return anything. It should print out the digits of num in reverse order. For example:

- `printReversedDigits(0)` should print `0` (but it should not return anything).
- `printReversedDigits(8)` should print `8` (but it should not return anything).
- `printReversedDigits(13)` should print `31` (but it should not return anything).
- `printReversedDigits(100000)` should print `000001` (but it should not return anything).
- `printReversedDigits(92456)` should print `65429` (but it should not return anything).

HINT: You can (and should) re-use code from you wrote on a problem from the For/While Loops Skills Lab assignment!
