# 3.4 Methods skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a class called `ArrayListUtils`.

TASK: Write a `public` method called `maxOdd` with an `ArrayList<Integer>` parameter `nums`, which you can assume to be non-empty. You may also assume that all of the numbers are non-negative. Fill in the body of `maxOdd` such that it returns the largest odd number in `nums`. If no odd numbers exist, return `0`.

HINT: Make a variable to keep track of the largest odd number you've seen to date. Then, loop through the array; whenever you encounter an odd number that's bigger than the current largest, update the current largest.

NOTE:  Do not print anything. We take care of printing behind the scenes. But you should return something.

NOTE: You do not need to create a class. Just write the method.
