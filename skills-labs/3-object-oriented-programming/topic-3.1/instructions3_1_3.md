# 3.1 Objects, arrays and ArrayLists skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 3
### Instructions:
We have declared a variable of type `int` called `n`.

TASK: Create a variable of type `int[][]` called `products` that has `n` rows and `n` columns (i.e., `n`-by-`n`) in which the i-th row of the j-th column contains the product `(i + 1) * (j + 1)`.

EXAMPLE: `products[0][0]` is `1 * 1 = 1`, and `products[3][3]` is `4 * 4 = 16`.

NOTE:  Do not print anything. We take care of printing behind the scenes. Just create the 2d array

NOTE: You do not need to create a class or a main method. Just write the code to create the 2d array.

HINT: Review the lecture slides on arrays - they contain a blueprint for looping through a 2-D array that you will find helpful
