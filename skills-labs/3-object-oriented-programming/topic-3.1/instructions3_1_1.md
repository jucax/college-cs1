# 3.1 Objects, arrays and ArrayLists skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have declared a variable of type `int[]` called `nums` , which you can assume to be non-empty.

TASK: Compute and print the average of the numbers in `nums`.

NOTE: You do not need to create a class or a main method. Just write the code to compute and print the average.

HINT: Recall, the average is equal to the sum of all of the numbers, divided by the number of numbers.
