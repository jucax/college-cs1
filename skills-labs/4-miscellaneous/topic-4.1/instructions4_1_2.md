# 4.1 Static variables and methods skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 2
### Instructions:
TASK: Create a class called `PrimitivePrinter` that has 7 overloaded versions of a `public static print` method (none of which return anything):

One version should have one `byte` parameter `x` and should print `x is a byte`
One version should have one `short` parameter `x` and should print `x is a short`
One version should have one `int` parameter `x` and should print `x is an int`
One version should have one `long` parameter `x` and should print `x is a long`
One version should have one `float` parameter `x` and should print `x is a float`
One version should have one `double` parameter `x` and should print `x is a double`
One version should have one `char` parameter `x` and should print `x is a char`

EXAMPLE: Running `PrimitivePrinter.print(42)` should print `x is an int`

NOTE: You only need to create the `PrimitivePrinter` class. You do not need to write a `main` method.
