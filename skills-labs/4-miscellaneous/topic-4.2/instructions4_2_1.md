# 4.2 Scanner lookahead skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 3
### Instructions:
TASK: Fill in the program below such that it does the following:

- Create a `Scanner` object that reads from `System.in`
- Prompt the user to enter their first name by printing the following: "Enter your first name:" (no quotes)
- Read the next `String` entered by the user, and store it in a variable called `firstName`
- Prompt the user to enter their last name by printing the following: "Enter your last name:" (no quotes)
- Read the next `String` entered by the user, and store it in a variable called `lastName`
- Print the following: "Hello, `firstName` `lastName`!" (no quotes)

NOTE: In the lecture slides we used `System.out.print` for scanner prompts. For this problem, please use `System.out.println` for everything that you print out - including the user prompts and the output message.

EXAMPLE: The program should always first prompt me with the following:

```
Enter your first name:
```

If I type "Arjun" (no quotes) and hit enter, it should prompt me with the following:

```
Enter your last name:
```

If I type "Chandrasekhar" (no quotes) and hit enter, it should print the following:

```
Hello, Arjun Chandrasekhar!
```
