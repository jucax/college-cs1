## Exercise 3 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `month` such that 1 ≤ `month` ≤ 12, where 1 corresponds to January, 2 corresponds to February, etc. Assume February has 28 days (i.e., it's not a leap year).

TASK: Print the number of days in the first **month** months (inclusive).

EXAMPLE: If **month** is 2, you would print 59 because there's 31 days in January and 28 days in February, so 31 + 28 = 59.

HINT: For your convenience, here is a list of months with the number of days they have:

- 1 = January = 31
- 2 = February = 28
- 3 = March = 31
- 4 = April = 30
- 5 = May = 31
- 6 = June = 30
- 7 = July = 31
- 8 = August = 31
- 9 = September = 30
- 10 = October = 31
- 11 = November = 30
- 12 = December = 31

HINT: One elegant way to solve this involves a switch statement that doesn't include any breaks!
