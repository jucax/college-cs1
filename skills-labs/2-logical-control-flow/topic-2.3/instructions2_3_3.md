# 2.3 Nested loops, boolean flags, break, continue skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have created a variable called sentence of type `String` called `sentence` with the following line of code:

```
String sentence = "???"; // sentence can have any String value
```

TASK: Create a variable called `condensedSentence` which contains the same contents as `sentence`, but with all of the spaces removed.

HINT: use a loop with a `continue` statement!
