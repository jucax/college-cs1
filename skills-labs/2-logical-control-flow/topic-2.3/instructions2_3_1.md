# 2.3 Nested loops, boolean flags, break, continue skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called **num** with the following line of code:

```
int num = ???; // 'num' can have any int value
```

TASK: Print a centered triangle with `num` asterisks (`*`) on the bottom row, `num - 2` asterisks on the next bottom row, ..., and 1 asterisk on the top row, where the triangle is surrounded by hyphens (`-`). You can assume that `num` is odd and is at least `3`.

EXAMPLE: If `num` is `5`, the resulting triangle would be the following:

```
--*--
-***-
*****
```
