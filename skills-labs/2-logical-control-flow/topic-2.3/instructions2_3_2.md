# 2.3 Nested loops, boolean flags, break, continue skills lab
## Exercise 2 / 3
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `int` called `num` with the following line of code:

```
int num = ???; // 'num' can have any int value
```

TASK: Print `"Prime"` (with no quotation marks) if `num` is prime. Otherwise, print `"Composite"`. You may assume that num is an integer greater than 1.

HINT: Recall that a number is considered "prime" if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. In other words, `num` is prime if it is NOT divisible by any number between `2` and `num - 1`; however, if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is composite.

HINT: Use a `boolean` flag, and a `break` statement!
