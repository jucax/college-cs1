# 2.2 While/For loops skills lab
## Exercise 1 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have defined a variable variable of type `int` called `numAsterisks` with the following line of code:

```
int numAsterisks = ???; // numAsterisks can have any value
```

TASK: Print out a row of asterisks (i.e. the character '*'). The number of asterisks printed should be equal to the value of numAsterisks.

EXAMPLE: If `numAsterisks` is 5, you would print the following:

```
*****
```

NOTE: You do not need to create a class or a main method. We have done that behind the scenes.
