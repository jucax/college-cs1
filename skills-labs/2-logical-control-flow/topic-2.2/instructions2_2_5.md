# 2.2 While/For loops skills lab
## Exercise 5 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have declared a variable of type `int` called `num`.

TASK: print out all of the digits of `num` in reverse order.

HINT: You may wish to review the lecture questions on operators - you completed a task that shows you how to separate the last digit from the first n - 1 digits!

HINT: A `do-while` loop is an elegant way to handle one of the edge cases! Another approach would be to covert `num` to a `String` and use a `for` loop.
