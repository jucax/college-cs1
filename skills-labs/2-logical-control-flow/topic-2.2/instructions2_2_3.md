# 2.2 While/For loops skills lab
## Exercise 3 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have already defined a variable of type `String` called `name` with the following line of code:

```
String name = "???";  // 'name' can have any String value
```

TASK: Print a welcome message "Hello, `name`! Welcome to CS 7! :)" surrounded by a box of asterisks (*) with spaces separating the box and your text.

EXAMPLE: If `name` is "Newman", you would print the following:

```
**************************************
*                                    *
* Hello, Newman! Welcome to CS 7! :) *
*                                    *
**************************************
```

EXAMPLE: If `name` was "Jerry", you would print the following:

```
*************************************
*                                   *
* Hello, Jerry! Welcome to CS 7! :) *
*                                   *
*************************************
```

NOTE: Notice how the length of `name` affects the length of the message, which in turn affects the number of surrounding asterisks and spaces.

NOTE: You do not need to create a class or main method, and you do not need to create the variable `name`. We have done all of that behind the scenes.

HINT: Try to re-use your code from the previous two problems! Figure out how many asterisks go on the 1st/5th rows, and figure out how many spaces go on the 2nd/4th rows.
