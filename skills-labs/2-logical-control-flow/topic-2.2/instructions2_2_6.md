# 2.2 While/For loops skills lab
## Exercise 6 / 7
### Instructions:
Assume we have declared a variable of type `int` called `num`.

TASK: print out all of the sum of the digits of `num`. For example:

- If `num` is `0` then you should print `0`
- If `num` is `8` then you should print `8`
- If `num` is `13` then you should print `4` (1 + 3)
- If `num` is `100000` then you should print `1` (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)
- If `num` is `92456` then you should print `26` (9 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6)

HINT: You may wish to review the lecture questions on operators - you completed a task that shows you how to separate the last digit from the first n - 1 digits!
